      <h1>What is Back-end?</h1>
      <p>As opposed to front-end developers who makes applications and other
        software user friendly and designs them, a back-end developer
        does all the work that the user can't see or interact with.
      <br>
        Such as the
        core functional logic behind the product.
      <br>
        Back-end is also referred to as
        "The server side", meaning that the Back-end developers are the ones who
        maintain, update and works with possible security issues within the software.
